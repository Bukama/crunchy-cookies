# The Crunchy Cookie Company
#### Java Stream workshop for beginners

Note that I made this in Java 13.

The Crunchy Cookie Company is in trouble and it needs your help to figure out how 
to solve its problems. It needs to handle data in several different ways.

Java Streams to the rescue!

But don't worry, this will be easy as pie. We will start from the simple stuff (like flour,
eggs and sugar) and work our way up to Super Secret Ingredients (like ginger, love
and "a sense of impending doom").

To begin, simply clone this repository to your local machine and follow the 
instructions in the different packages. We recommend NOT looking into the 
`com.javax1.cookies.secrets` package and running the unit tests to validate your
results.

If you feel stuck, check the documentation on the "Hint" interface the class your
problem is in is implementing. Most IDEs let you do that with hovering your mouse
over the method.

If you just want the solutions, there is a "solutions" branch with my solutions. 
This was made by a single person, so it might not fit your needs and needs to be 
evaluated before applying to real world problems.

Eldritch means unearthly, supernatural or eerie.
Popularized by the works of H. P. Lovecraft.
